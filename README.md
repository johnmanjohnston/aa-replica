# aa-replica
A game made in Unity inspired by the popular 2D game, "aa"

## About
The aa-replica is programmed in C# using Unity. It has a spinning circle in the middle, which the projectiles will stick to, once fired. 
You can press the space bar to shoot a projectile, and they will be impulsed upwards. If they hit the board, the projectile will become a child GameObject of the board.
If it hits another pin, it will still stick, but that projectile will turn into a different color, and the board will slowly stop spinning. 
The aa-replica uses TextMeshPro for clearer text because Unity's built in text is pretty bad.
